# Project Overview

**Description**
This project analyzes a dataset of employees of  ABC company, exploring various attributes such as salary, age, height, position, and team distribution. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), graphical representation, and correlation insights to uncover meaningful patterns.

# Preprocessing Steps

**Handling Missing Values:**
Missing values in numeric columns were replaced with their mean values.
Missing values in non-numeric (categorical) columns were replaced with the placeholder "Unknown".

**Height Adjustment:** The Height column was replaced with random values between 150 and 180 to ensure consistency.

# Analysis Tasks and Graphical Representations

**Team Distribution:**

The distribution of employees across teams was calculated and represented in a bar chart.
Percentage splits of employees per team were also provided.

**Position Distribution:**

Employees were segregated based on their positions.
A pie chart was used to visualize the percentage of employees in each position.

**Age Group Analysis:**

Employees were categorized into predefined age groups: 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, and 60+.
A bar chart illustrated the distribution of employees across these age groups.

**Salary Expenditure Analysis:**

Total salary expenditure for each team and position was calculated.
Bar charts were used to display salary expenditure by teams and positions.

**Correlation Analysis:**

The correlation between age and salary was investigated.
A scatter plot, along with a trendline, was used to represent the relationship visually. The correlation coefficient was found to be 0.21, indicating a weak positive correlation.

# Insights Gained

**Team Insights:**
Teams with the highest employee representation and salary expenditures were identified.

**Position Insights:**
Positions with the highest representation and salary expenditures were highlighted.

**Age Insights:**
Most employees fell into the 18-30 age group.
The dataset showed limited representation in higher age groups (41+).

**Salary Trends:**
Salary expenditures varied significantly across teams and positions.
A weak positive correlation between age and salary was observed.
